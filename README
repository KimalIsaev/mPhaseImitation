command for compilation:
	clang -O3 -lm avl_tree.c distribution_functions.c read_double_pair_from_file.c \ 
		main.c -o mPhaseImitation.exe
usage:
	./mPhaseImiation.exe path_to_rng_file.raw N_device X_flow X_orbit Q_R0 Q_R1 
		Q_phase1 Q_phase2 .. Q_phaseM X_phase1 X_phase2 .. X_phaseM
	path_to_rng_file.raw: path to file with random generated 14-byte numbers
		number of steps will be done by program is file_size / 14 
        N_devices: amount of devices in system
        X_flow: intensity of puasson flow. which generating input request
        X_orbit: intensity of one request in orbit
        Q_R0: probability to exit system after device executed request
        Q_R0: probability to be executed again
                after device executed request already
        Q_R2 = 1-(Q_R1+Q_R2):  probability to orbit
                after device executed request
        Q_phases: multiple non-negative values,
                sum of which must be equal to one,
                defines probability to use phase with same index
        X_phases: multiple positive values
                (same number of values as Q-phases had),
                defines intensity of phase with same index
